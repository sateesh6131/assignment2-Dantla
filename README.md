#### Code fencing

> The idea is based on Legendreâ€™s formula which finds largest power of a prime number that divides fact!. We find all prime factors of n. For every prime factor we find largest power of it that divides fact!. Finally we return minimum of all found powers.

```
int fact_pow (int n, int k) {
    int res = 0;
    while (n) {
        n /= k;
        res += n;
    }
    return res;
}
